                    Hi, my name is Yukihide, and I'm a software developer working in Tokyo, Japan. Welcome to my portfolio page.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I've chosen a simple design for this website because of the amount of
                    written content I wanted to include. It looks more plain than my
                    previous websites, which can be found in the footnote.
                </p>
            </div>
        </>)
